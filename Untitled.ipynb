    "# Description\n",
    "There are N fields 1, 2, . . ., N that grow the same agricultural product. The field i has amount of product d(i) and needs to be harvested on one day from s(i) to e(i). The processing factory has the capacity M which is the maximum amount of product it can process each day. Moreover, if the total amount of product available is less than m, the factory will not work (as the efficiency is not good). \n",
